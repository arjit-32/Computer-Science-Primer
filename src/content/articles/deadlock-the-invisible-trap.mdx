The other day, I was re-visiting my notes on operating systems when “deadlocks“ caught my eye. 
To illustrate, imagine a traffic jam where each car is stuck, waiting for the other to move; no one can go forward, and nothing progresses. That’s essentially what happens inside your system during a deadlock.

Given the reliance of web applications on underlying operating systems, I wondered if this often-overlooked issue issue quietly affects performance of my state-of-the-art Todo app. 

Spoiler alert - it can and it does, the most commonly used OS for web servers(Linux) has made many developers and sysadmins tear their hair out over the "deadlock issue."

## What is Deadlock

In operating systems, deadlocks occur when two or more processes are stuck waiting for each other to release resources, creating a cycle of dependency where none of the processes can proceed. 

Rather than diving into the technical details of deadlock conditions or solutions, let’s take a closer look at deadlocks from the perspective of software developers.

## Why Should a Software Developer Care?

You might be thinking: I’m not building kernels, why should I care ?

- Every web server relies on an OS - Understanding how your chosen OS handles resources like memory and file locks can prevent unwanted surprises. A web server stuck in a deadlock could slow down your entire application, affecting user experience and system performance.
Example - A web server running on Linux might experience a deadlock when multiple users access the same file, but the application is responsible for handling it and gives a granular control. While Windows is more proactive and prevents deadlock so is better for enterprise apps.

- Your code might create deadlocks - You don’t need to touch OS internals to encounter deadlocks. Writing bad or careless queries/code can lead to deadlocks in higher-level programming too.

    ### Real-World Deadlock Examples in Development
    
    #### Example 1 - Simultaneous updates in MySQL
    
    Two transactions try to transfer money between the same accounts but in opposite directions. Each one locks a row the other needs.
    
    ```sql
        -- Transaction A
    START TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- Locks account 1
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2; -- Locks account 2
    COMMIT;

    -- Transaction B
    START TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 50 WHERE account_id = 2; -- Locks account 2 
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50 WHERE account_id = 1; -- Locks account 1
    COMMIT;
    ```

    Result is that both transactions end up waiting on each other - creating a circular wait and triggering a deadlock.
    
    
    #### Example 2 - Inconsistent Lock Order in a Node.js Web AP
    
    A REST API allows money transfers. If two requests try to transfer in opposite directions, but lock accounts in different order, a deadlock can occur.
    
    ```javascript
    const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');

    async function transfer(fromId, toId, amount) {
        const connection = await mysql.createConnection({ /* connection config */ });

        try {
            await connection.beginTransaction();

            // ⚠️ Risky: Lock order depends on input
            await connection.query(
                'UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE account_id = ?',
                [amount, fromId]
            );
            await connection.query(
                'UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE account_id = ?',
                [amount, toId]
            );

            await connection.commit();
        } catch (err) {
            await connection.rollback();
            console.error("Transaction failed:", err);
        } finally {
            await connection.end();
        }
    }
    ```

    Safer Version – Always Lock in Consistent Order
    ```javascript
    const ids = [fromId, toId].sort(); // Lock accounts in consistent order

    await connection.query(
        'UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE account_id = ?',
        [amount, ids[0]]
    );
    await connection.query(
        'UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE account_id = ?',
        [amount, ids[1]]
    );
    ```
    

## How Deadlocks Surface in Popular Web Stacks

Deadlocks can emerge not just from OS-level behavior but also due to how the web server (or runtime) handles concurrency, threads, and resources. Let’s take a look at where deadlocks might appear in different web server environments and runtimes:

### Apache HTTP Server

- Platforms: Linux, Windows
- Issue: When using the prefork MPM model, each request spawns a separate process. Under high load, this can lead to resource exhaustion and potential deadlocks.
- Recommendation: Use worker or event MPM instead, which are more efficient and better at handling concurrency without locking conflicts.

### Nginx

- Platform: Primarily Linux (limited Windows support)
- Strength: Nginx uses an event-driven, non-blocking architecture that scales exceptionally well with high traffic.
- Caution: On Windows, its performance degrades due to poorer support for asynchronous I/O, which can indirectly contribute to resource contention or latency under load.

### Internet Information Services (IIS)

- Platform: Windows-only
- Behavior: Thread and connection pooling in IIS can lead to contention if not configured properly under heavy load.
- Recommendation: Tweak settings like application pool recycling, idle timeouts, and max concurrent requests to avoid contention that could cause application-level deadlocks.

### NodeJs (Runtime, Often Used as Web Server)

- Platform: Cross-platform
- Strength: Its single-threaded event loop architecture inherently reduces the chances of deadlocks in traditional sense.
- Caveat: While Node.js avoids classic OS-level deadlocks, poor use of asynchronous code, callback hell, or unoptimized database interactions can still cause the application to “appear stuck” or non-responsive ( I like to call it kind of a logical deadlock )

_Note - Node.js is’nt a web server by itself but in many modern stacks( like with Express) it functions as one by handling HTTP requests directly._

### Apache Tomcat

- Platform: Java-based, cross-platform
- Issue: When deployed on Windows under high concurrency, its thread pool may become saturated. If threads are waiting on shared resources or locks, this can resemble a deadlock.
- Recommendation: Tune maxThreads in server.xml and ensure thread-safe resource access in your Java code.


## Choosing the Right OS & Server for Your Application

Use Case              | Recommended Stack
High Traffic Web Apps | Linux with Apache (worker/event MPM) or Nginx - optimized for high concurrency and performance
Real-time Apps        | Node.js on Linux - non-blocking, event-driven architecture ideal for low-latency interactions
Enterprise Apps       | IIS on Windows - reliable for enterprise workloads with proper tuning of app pools and threads

## Best Practices for Preventing deadlocks

### 1. Consistent Locking Order

Always acquire locks in a predefined order.

```sql
-- Always lock account 1 before account 2
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- Lock account 1
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2; -- Lock account 2
COMMIT;
```

### 2. Set Transaction Timeouts

Set a timeout for your transaction to avoid waiting indefinitely.

```sql
SET innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 5; -- Timeout after 5 seconds
```

### 3. Enable Deadlock Detection

Enable deadlock detection in your database settings, allowing it to roll back a transaction when a deadlock is detected.

```sql
-- MySQL automatically detects deadlocks; you can check the status with:
SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;
```

### 4. Minimize Locking Scope

Lock only the resources that are absolutely necessary, and avoid holding locks longer than needed.

```sql
-- Instead of locking the entire table, lock only the rows that need updating
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1; -- Lock only the required row
COMMIT;
```

### 5. Use Read Committed Isolation Level

In databases that support transaction isolation levels, using the "Read Committed" isolation level can help prevent deadlocks by reducing unnecessary locks.

```sql
-- Set isolation level to Read Committed to reduce lock contention
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

```

## Monitoring and Resolving Deadlocks

Tools like **MySQL Workbench** and **pgAdmin** provide visual representations of database activity and can help identify deadlock situations by showing locks and transactions. Some other Application Performance Monitoring tools are **Datadog** and **NewRelic.** If somebody wants I can go into deep-dive of these tools.

## Notable Case Studies

### 1. Apache Deadlocks (2002)

In 2002, Apache faced deadlock issues primarily due to its multi-threaded handling of requests. 

*Cause -* The threading model of Apache, combined with Linux's resource management at the kernel level, created a situation where threads were waiting on each other indefinitely.

### 2. NFS (Network File System) deadlocks

NFS experienced deadlock situations when multiple machines accessed the same files across a network. 
*Cause -* If one machine crashed or had network issues, locks that were supposed to be released remained held, leading to other machines waiting indefinitely.

### 3. MySQL 5.0 Deadlocks

MySQL databases, especially version 5.0 released in 2005, faced significant deadlock scenarios during transaction processing. 

*Cause -* Deadlock arose from the way transactions acquired locks on rows. Ex- Transaction A locked Row 1 and then tried to lock Row 2 while Transaction B had already locked Row 2 and was attempting to lock Row 1, they would block each other indefinitely.

### 4. Docker Deadlocks (2016)

 In 2016, Docker containers exhibited deadlock issues due to resource contention. 
*Cause -* When one container became resource-heavy, it could monopolize CPU cycles or memory, leaving other containers starved for the same resources eventually leading to indefinite wait.

## Conclusion

A proactive approach to deadlock prevention improves software reliability, enhances user experience, and protects organizations from costly downtime.
