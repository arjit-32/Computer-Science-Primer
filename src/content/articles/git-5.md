Merging combines changes from one branch into another. Typically, we merge feature branches into the **main** branch.

## Performing a Merge

```bash
git checkout master # Switched to target branch
git merge experimental # Merging feature branch into master
```

## Types of Merges

1. **Fast Forward Merge / Simple Merge -** Occurs when master has no new commits since feature branch in created. Git just moves branch forward without creating a merge commit.
2. **Recursive Merge -** Happens when master also has new commits, then Git created a new merge commit to combine changes.

## Handling Merge Conflicts

Sometimes the changes made on the branches conflict with one another. Ex - D, E and H changed the same lines of code as F and G. 

```bash
git status # Show conflicted files
cat file # When you open the file, you notice how git marks the conflict
```

We can add or remove the lines as necessary and then simply 

```bash
git commit -am 'merged experimental branch in master'
```

## Aborting a Merge

```bash
git merge --abort # If something goes wrong before merge is committed

git reset --hard HEAD~1 # If merge is already committed
```

## Cherry Picking

Cherry-picking allows you to **pick a specific commit** from one branch and apply it to another, without merging everything.
