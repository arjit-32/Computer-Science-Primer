Welcome to the first article of Java for DSA series! Before diving into algorithms and data structures, it's essential to understand the language and environment we'll be working with.

## Features of Java

✅ **Simple & Portable** – Easy to learn and write, and runs across different platforms.

🧱 **Object-Oriented** – Everything is modeled as objects.

🌐 **Platform Independent** – Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA).

🔐 **Secure & Dynamic** – Features like bytecode verification and dynamic linking.

⚡ **High Performance** – Thanks to the **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler.

🛡️ **Robust** – Automatic garbage collection and strong memory management.

🔁 **Multithreaded** – Supports concurrent execution for better performance.

## Structure of Program

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
// compiling - javac test.java
// running - java test
```
