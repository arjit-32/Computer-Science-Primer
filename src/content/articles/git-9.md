Its the key to a Clean and Linear History.

Instead of merging (which creates an extra merge commit), **rebasing applies your commits one by one on top of the new base**. 

Generally when we have a feature branch and we merge it with our master, but it has few drawbacks like 

- history gets more complicated
- There is an extra change when 2 branches are merged

What we really want our history to look is like this

Thats where rebase comes in. 

```bash
git rebase <base-branch>
# If conflict occurs then ->
git rebase --continue
```

## Rebase in Action

You have a `feature1` branch based on an old `master` branch. Before merging, you **want to update it to the latest `master` changes**.

```bash
git checkout feature1
git rebase master  # Rebase feature1 onto the latest master

# After resolving the conflict
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

After our rebase this is how our codebase looks -

Now changes are in one line and we can merge feature1 branch into master branch ( as master is still behind ) 

```bash
git checkout master
git merge feature1
git log --all --graph --oneline
```

`Note` - You can see Fast-Forward in terminal, that means there arent any new changes that need to be made so master branch pointer moves to HEAD.
