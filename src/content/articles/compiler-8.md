## What Is Linking?

Once each part of a program is compiled into machine code (object files), the linker combines these files with libraries (like pre-written code for printf) into a single executable file. Itâ€™s like assembling a puzzle, connecting all pieces to make a complete picture.

The linker:

- Merges multiple object files.
- Resolves references (e.g., connects printf to its code in the C library).
- Creates a program you can run.

## Types of Linking

- **Static Linking**: All code (including libraries) is packaged into one big executable
- **Dynamic Linking**: External libraries (like `.dll` or `.so` files) are linked at runtime, keeping the executable smaller

## What Is Execution?

1. The OS loads the binary into memory
2. Sets up a stack *(for variables)* and heap *(for dynamic data)*
3. Initializes registers and jumps to the start point (like `main()`)
4. The CPU starts executing your instructions
