## What is UI/UX?

**User Interface (UI):** The visual elements of a product that users interact with, such as buttons, menus, icons, and layouts. UI focuses on aesthetics, consistency, and the overall look and feel of the product.

**User Experience (UX):** The process of designing the overall experience of using a product. UX emphasizes usability, efficiency, and user satisfaction, ensuring the product solves user problems seamlessly.
