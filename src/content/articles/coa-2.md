If computer architecture is the blueprint, the processor is the engine that makes it all run. In this article, we explore the internal structure of a CPU, what it’s made of and how its parts interact.

## The ALU: Where the Actual Work Happens

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is the component that performs basic operations like adding numbers, comparing values, doing bitwise logic (AND, OR, NOT).

ALU gets its inputs from *registers*, and sends results back to *them or memory*, all under the guidance of the *Control Unit*.

## Registers: The CPU’s Short-Term Memory

Registers are tiny storage units inside the processor, used for holding temporary data. They’re much faster than RAM, but also much smaller in number.

Some of the registers are -

- **Program Counter (PC)** - tracks the next instruction to execute
- **Instruction Register (IR)** - holds the current instruction being decoded
- **Stack Pointer (SP)** - used in function calls and memory management.

## Buses: The Communication Highways

To move data between the ALU, memory, and registers, CPUs use buses*(shared electrical lines)*

- **Data Bus** carries raw values
- **Address Bus** carries locations in memory
- **Control Bus** carries signals like “read” or “write”

All operations in the CPU depend on these buses to stay synchronized.

## Clock: The Pulse of the Processor

The CPU’s timing is managed by a clock. Its a tiny oscillator that sends regular electrical pulses. A 3 GHz processor has a clock that ticks **3 billion times per second**.

## The Control Unit: The CPU’s Brain

The Control Unit decodes the current instruction and manages the operations like telling the ALU when to compute, selecting registers, signaling memory reads and writes.

## Conclusion

Every program you use *(browser, games etc)* ends up as a series of binary instructions. These instructions flow through this internal structure where registers hold intermediate values, ALU computes. registers hold result, everything flows through a bus, synchronized using a clock and managed by Control Unit.
