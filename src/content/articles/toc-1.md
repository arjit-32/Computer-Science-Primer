## The Origin of the Idea

Long before high-level programming languages existed, mathematicians tried to answer a deep question -

*“Can we model human reasoning and mechanical computation with formal systems? “*

This led to the birth of automata theory, a branch of theoretical computer science that models simple machines capable of understanding structured input.

Key figures in development of the field are -

- **Alan Turing (1936)**: Created the Turing Machine, the simplest possible machine that can simulate any algorithm. This became the formal definition of "computability".
- **Alonzo Church**: Worked on lambda calculus, another formal system showing how functions and logic could be expressed.
- **Stephen Kleene**: Introduced the concept of regular expressions and invented Kleene star (∗) and positive closure (+) which are now core to pattern matching.
- **Noam Chomsky (1956)**: Developed the Chomsky hierarchy, a classification of formal grammars based on their complexity.

These ideas formed the mathematical foundation of compilers, interpreters, and all modern programming languages.

## The Building Blocks of Automata Theory

![building-blocks-of-toc](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwa6rcttw/image/upload/v1747728724/building-block-toc_nefsfi.png)

To model how machines understand patterns, lets first start with some basic concepts:

- **Symbol:** Basic building block which can be character or token. e.g- a,b,1,2 etc.
- **Alphabet (Σ)**: A finite set of symbols. e.g- {a, b} or {0, 1}.
- **String**: A finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet. e.g- abb, 1010
- **Language (L)**: A set of valid strings over an alphabet. e.g- All strings with an even number of 1s.

### Operations

- **Concatenation**: ab means symbol a followed by b
- **Union**: a ∪ b means either a or b
- **Kleene Closure (*)**: a* means zero or more a’s (ε, a, aa, aaa, ...)
- **Positive Closure (+)**: a+ means one or more a’s (a, aa, aaa, ...)

These operations are what make regular expressions possible and regular expressions define the simplest class of languages that computers can recognize.

## Why Does This Matter for Developers?

Every compiler’s or interpreter’s initial 2 steps are -

1. Lexical analysis - Breaks your code into tokens (e.g., `while`, `if`, `123`, `=`)
2. Syntax analysis - Checks if those tokens follow the grammar

These first two stages are automata in action. *Lexical analyzers use finite automata and regular expressions* while *Syntax analyzers use context-free grammars.* So, before we can write or understand a compiler, we need to know how machines process structured input which is exactly what automata theory teaches us
