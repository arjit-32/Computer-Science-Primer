Programming languages are fascinating. But have you ever wondered **how they work under the hood?** As an academic exercise, I set out to build my own programming language [hindilang](https://github.com/arjit-32/hindilang), a Hindi inspired scripting language that transpiles to JavaScript!

## A Quick Taste of hindilang

[**hindilang**](https://github.com/arjit-32/hindilang) provides fundamental programming constructs like printing, inputs, conditional, loops and comments (obviously with `hindi` flavour).

Here are some examples

1. **Variables and Printing**
```javascript
MANLO x = 5;
CHAPO x;

// Output
5
```

2. **Taking User Input**

```javascript
PUCHO y;
CHAPO y;

// (If user enters 10)
// Output is 10
```

3. **Conditional Statements (if)**

```javascript
MANLO x = 5;

AGAR (x > 3) {
    CHAPO "X bada hai!";
}

// Output
// X bada hai
```

4. **Loops (while)**

```javascript
MANLO x = 5;

JABTAK (x < 10) {
    CHAPO x;
    MANLO x = x + 1;
}

// Output
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9
// 10
```


5. **Comments**

```javascript
# Yeh ek comment hai

//(Comments are ignored during execution)
```

## Theoritical part 

Well, we won't get into much theory _(if you're interested checkout [compiler series](/series/compiler))_ but one thing that is quite practical and usefull is grammar. Its the rules we give to our language _( what comes after what)_. <br/>
This language follows a **BNF-like grammar** (Backus-Naur Form) to define its syntax. Here’s a simplified structure:

```bash
<program> ::= <statement_list>

<statement_list> ::= <statement> <newline> <statement_list>
                   | <statement> <newline>
                   | ε   (* Empty Line Allowed *)

<statement> ::= <assignment>
              | <print_statement>
              | <input_statement>
              | <if_statement>
              | <while_loop>

<assignment> ::= "MANLO" <identifier> "=" <expression> ";"

<print_statement> ::= "CHAPO" <expression> ";"

<input_statement> ::= "PUCHO" <identifier> ";"

<if_statement> ::= "AGAR" "(" <condition> ")" "{" <statement_list> "}"

<while_loop> ::= "JABTAK" "(" <condition> ")" "{" <statement_list> "}"

```

If you were unable to follow, thats completely fine. To sum it up, we make a mental model of what our programming language should look like !

## How it works ? (The Broader Picture) 

![compiler](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwa6rcttw/image/upload/v1745825452/hindiland_cigvqt.png)

- Lexer → Tokenizes your code
- Parser → Matches grammar rules, decides meaning
- Emitter → Spits out JS code at each parser step

---

## Understanding Code Flow with a Example 🚀

Lets take a simple example and see how everything works together. 

### Input
You start with source:

```
MANLO x = 5;
CHAPO x;
```
### ➔ Lexer Phase (Tokenization)
- Lexer has `this.source = "MANLO x = 5;\nCHAPO x;"`.
- It moves char-by-char.
- Each time it recognizes something (e.g., a word, number, symbol), it creates a Token object:


|Source Text | Lexer Creates |
|------------|---------------|
| MANLO |	Token(text=MANLO, kind=MANLO)|
|x	| Token(text=x, kind=IDENT)|
|=	|Token(text==, kind=EQ)|
|5	|Token(text=5, kind=NUMBER)|
|;	|Token(text=;, kind=SEMICOLON)|
|CHAPO	|Token(text=CHAPO, kind=CHAPO)|
|x	|Token(text=x, kind=IDENT)|
|;	|Token(text=;, kind=SEMICOLON)|
|EOF	|Token(text=\0, kind=EOF)|

Lexer forgets after giving Token - it just reads forward.

### ➔ Parser Phase (Grammar + Logic)
- Parser calls `lexer.getToken()` to get one Token at a time.
- It uses `checkToken()` and `match()` to enforce your language's grammar (like MANLO must be followed by IDENT then a = so on. ).
- If the tokens are not in correct order, Parser aborts with an error.

|Language Keyword | Parser Expectation |
|-----------------|---------------|
|MANLO | Needs: `IDENT` then `=` then `expression` and then `;`|
|CHAPO | Needs: `STRING or IDENT` then `;` |

If you check the [code](https://github.com/arjit-32/hindilang/blob/main/src/parser.js) (*statement function*), you'll notice it follows a **recursive descent parsing** approach and supports **LL(1) parsing**, meaning it looks at only one token at a time without backtracking.

### ➔ Emitter Phase (Code Generation)
- While parsing, at the same time, Parser calls `emitter.emit()` and `emitter.emitLine()` to generate the final JavaScript code.
- It builds the output file line-by-line.


|Parser action | Emitter output|
|--------------|-----------|
|MANLO x = 5; | let x = 5;|
|CHAPO x; | console.log(x);|

### Final JavaScript Output
```
let x = 5;
console.log(x);
```

## Deeper Dive: What’s Next?

Right now, hindilang is a **transpiler** (converts one high-level language to another). But if we wanted to build a ✌true compiler✌ that generates machine code, we could explore:

 

1. **LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine)** - A compiler framework that generates optimized machine code for multiple architectures.

```css
hindilang → Lexer → Parser → LLVM IR → Machine Code (x86, ARM, etc.)
```

2. **Direct Assembly Code Generation** - Emit **x86 assembly** and use an **assembler** (like `nasm`) to generate machine code.

3. **WebAssembly (WASM)** – A low-level binary format that runs on modern browsers.

---

## Conclusion: Seeing the Matrix 👀

I’d **100% recommend** building your own programming language. It fundamentally changes how you see code.

Beyond learning about **compiler internals**, you gain something even more valuable:

1. **Programming is Abstraction**

A high-level language is just a bunch of strings that the compiler accepts. The compiler dictates the language - it breaks it down, checks validity, and converts it to low-level code. Then the cycle repeats until we reach machine instructions.

2. **Errors? They Excite Me Now.**

In hindilang, I didn’t even bother giving useful message. Debugging feels less like a headache and more like a feature. Wow, atleast the language tells me where mistake might be !

3. **The Better You Understand Your Language, The Better You Write.**

Compilers don’t “think” they *follow rules*. The more you understand how they optimize (or struggle), the better you can write better code.

Now, every time I write code, I ask myself:

- What’s the *compiler doing*?
- How is it *parsing this statement*?
- How does this turn into *machine instructions*?
