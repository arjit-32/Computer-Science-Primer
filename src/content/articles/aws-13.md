When building backend services, you need a secure, scalable, and manageable way to expose them to clients. That’s where *API Gateway* comes in - your gateway to the cloud.

## What Is API Gateway?

AWS API Gateway is a *fully managed service* that enables developers to 
build, publish, and manage **RESTful** or **HTTP APIs**. It acts as a front door for your backend services, routing requests to AWS Lambda functions, EC2 instances, or other AWS services.

When to Use API Gateway:

- Exposing RESTful APIs for your application
- Handling API rate limiting and throttling
- Easy versioning and deployment of APIs

## How API Gateway Works

API Gateway acts as a proxy that receives HTTP requests from clients and routes them to the appropriate backend service.

1. **Request Handling**: The client sends a request *(e.g., POST /api/users).*
2. **Routing Traffic**: API Gateway routes the request to the appropriate backend *(Lambda, EC2, etc.)*.
3. **Response Handling**: It optionally transforms the response and returns it to the client.
4. **Scaling**: API Gateway scales automatically to handle millions of requests per second.

### Key Concepts in API Gateway (Quick Reference)

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| API | Entry point for clients to access services |
| Resource | URL path *(e.g., /users, /products).* |
| Method | The type of HTTP request *(GET, POST, etc.)* for a resource. |
| Integration | Backend connected to the method |
| Stage | A version of the API deployed for use *(e.g., dev, prod).* |
| Throttling & Rate Limiting | Controls the number of requests clients can make in a given period. |

## Setting Up a Simple REST API

### Step 1: Create an API

1. Go to *API Gateway → Create API*.
2. Choose **REST API** or **HTTP API**.
3. Define the *API Name* and *Description*.

### Step 2: Define Resources and Methods

1. Create a new *Resource* *(e.g., /users)*.
2. Define the **HTTP Method** *(e.g., GET, POST, PUT)*.
3. Connect methods to a backend *(e.g., Lambda, DynamoDB, or HTTP endpoints).*

### Step 3: Deploy the API

1. Create a *Stage* *(e.g., dev, prod).*
2. Deploy the API to the stage, which gives you a **public URL**.
