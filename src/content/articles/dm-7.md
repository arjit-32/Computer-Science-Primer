Graph theory, a fundamental branch of mathematics with its ability to model relationships and connections which makes it a must know tool for developers.

## What is a Graph ?

A graph is combination of

- Nodes (vertices) - Represents entities or objects.
- Edges - Represents relationships between nodes.

## Types of Graphs

- **Directed and Undirected -** In directed edges have a direction.
- **Weighted and Unweighted -** Edges carry a value representing cost/time/priority etc.
- **Cyclic vs Acyclic -** If a cycle exists within a graph or not.

## Representing a Graph in memory

1. Adjacency Matrix

1. Adjacency List

## Real-World Usage

1. **Dependency Management**

Package managers (npm, pip, cargo) build dependency graphs. Topological sorting ensures libraries are loaded in the correct order.

2. **Routing Systems**

Used in Path finding algorithms, traffic optimization and load balancing. 

3. **Algorithms**

Often used to model our problems into a graph data structures help in easy thinking and solutions. Be it social network or cities on a map, it is used everywhere.

## Conclusion

Graphs are probably the most key takeaway from discrete math that you will encounter in your day to day life as a software developer. Mastering them will not only help you in software engineering, but also emerging trends in machine learning and distributed systems.
