I always wanted to get my hands dirty with a operating systems project, so I *finally* did and set out to build my own shell. It was perfect choice: not too complex to scare soy-dev like me, yet rich enough to explore funamental concept of running a program via command line.

## What is a Shell

A shell is a command-line interface, i.e., instead of you clickity clackity on that mouse just enter a command and something happens on your computer, can be changing a folder or listing files and much more. Originating in the 1970s with the Unix shell, but now has many modern alternatives like Zsh and Fish, enhancing usability and scripting capabilities.

### The Broad Picture

![broad-picture-of-shell](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwa6rcttw/image/upload/v1748250979/Screenshot_2025-05-26_144533_t81wjg.png)

1️⃣ Start the shell → It shows a prompt and waits for user input.

2️⃣ User enters a command → The shell reads and tokenizes the input.

3️⃣  create a child process (`fork()`) → The child runs the command using `execvp()` .

4️⃣ Parent process waits (`wait()`) → Ensures the command finishes before taking new input.

5️⃣ Repeat until user exits → The loop continues, keeping the shell running.

*NOTE -  **execvp()** runs programs by searching for their executable file in the directories listed in the **$PATH** environment variable ( this includes system binaries and any custom programs installed in user-defined locations )*

---

## Lets Start with the Loop

The fundamental part of any shell is an **infinite loop** that keeps the shell running until the user decides to exit.

```c
void loop() {
    int quit = 0;

    do {
        // Take Input 
    } while (!quit);
}

int main() {
    loop();
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Taking Input

Now that we have an infinite loop running, the next step is to take user input so the shell can process commands.

```c
void loop() {
    char input[100]; // Buffer to store user input
    int quit = 0;

    do {
        printf("voshi> "); // Display the prompt
        fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin); // Read user input

        // Trim the newline character
        input[strcspn(input, "\n")] = '\0';

        // Check for exit command
        if (strcmp(input, "exit") == 0) {
            quit = 1;
        }

    } while (!quit);
}

int main() {
    loop();
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Execute User Command

Now that we have an **infinite loop** and can **take input**, the next step is to **execute user commands**

To run commands like *ls, echo, mkdir (in case of linux),*  we need to: 

- Create a Child Process using ***fork()***
- Replace it with the command ***execvp()***
- Make the parent wait until the command finished ***wait()***

![parent-child-process](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwa6rcttw/image/upload/v1748250978/Screenshot_2025-05-26_142252_izq5r8.png)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

void loop() {
    char input[100];
    int quit = 0;

    do {
        printf("voshi> ");
        fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);
        input[strcspn(input, "\n")] = '\0'; // Remove newline

        if (strcmp(input, "exit") == 0) {
            quit = 1;
            continue;
        }

        // Fork a process to run the command
        pid_t pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) { // Child process
            char *args[] = {input, NULL}; // Prepare command
            execvp(args[0], args);
            perror("exec failed"); // If command fails
            exit(1);
        } else { // Parent process
            wait(NULL); // Wait for child to finish
        }

    } while (!quit);
}

int main() {
    loop();
    return 0;
}
```

## Advanced Features

### History

A terminal can operate in **two modes** when accepting input from the user:

1. Canonical Mode (Line-Buffered Mode): The terminal buffers input until the user presses Enter (\n), then sends the entire line to the program.
2. Raw Mode (Character-Buffered Mode): **Every keystroke** is sent immediately to the program without waiting for enter.

We can also use **GNU Readline**, which operates in canonical mode but also gives us command history using arrow keys, which otherwise we would have to do it ourselves by enabling raw mode.

```c
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <readline/history.h>

void loop() {
    char *input;
    int quit = 0;
    
    using_history(); // Enable history tracking
		
		do{
   		input = readline("voshi> ");
   		
   		add_history(input); // Store command in history
			
   		// Rest of the code

```

### Custom Prompts

We can even show current directory we are present in like most shells do. 

```c
char *get_prompt() {
    static char prompt[PATH_MAX + 50]; // Store formatted prompt
    char cwd[PATH_MAX];

    if (getcwd(cwd, sizeof(cwd)) == NULL) {
        perror("getcwd failed");
        return "voshi> ";
    }

    snprintf(prompt, sizeof(prompt), "\033[1;32m%s\033[0m voshi> ", cwd);
    return prompt;
}
```

Now just have to modify the input taking to use 

```c
input = readline(get_prompt());
```

### Git branches

When working on projects, developers often switch branches. Displaying the **active Git branch in the prompt** would makes it easier to track the current context without running *git branch* manually.

Use `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null` to get current branch and `popen()` to capture the output.

```c
char *get_git_branch() {
    static char branch[100];
    FILE *fp = popen("git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null", "r");
    if (!fp) return "";

    if (fgets(branch, sizeof(branch), fp) != NULL) {
        branch[strcspn(branch, "\n")] = '\0'; // Remove newline
    }
    pclose(fp);
    return branch;
}
```

Now while creating a prompt you can add the line to put git branch

```c
char *get_prompt() {
 // ... Prev Code

char *git_branch = get_git_branch();
snprintf(prompt, sizeof(prompt), "\033[1;32m%s \033[1;34m(%s)\033[0m voshi> ", cwd, git_branch);
}
 
```

### SIGINT Handling (Ctrl+C)
When using a shell, pressing Ctrl+C sends the SIGINT (Signal Interrupt) to terminate a running process. To ensure graceful handling, instead of abruptly killing the shell, we can override the default behavior using a custom signal handler.

```c
void sigint_handler(int signo) {
    if (signo == SIGINT) {
        printf("\n\n\033[1;31mUse \"exit\" to quit voshi.\033[0m\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    }
}


int main() {
    signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler); // Register custom SIGINT handler
    // Rest of the code
    // ...
}
```

## Conclusion

Creating a shell is a fantastic way to understand **operating system internals**, process management, and input handling. 

Furthermore you can add tab completions, background process, job control and many more features to your custom shell, as for my case I added a dashboard, a place that gives me weather, hackernews & techcrunch news. You can download my shell from the [website](https://arjit-32.github.io/VOSHI/) or read the codebase from [github](https://github.com/arjit-32/VOSHI/blob/main/src/main.c) repo.
