## **Cloning a Remote repository**

Copying an **existing Git repository** from a remote server (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to your local machine. This allows you to work on a copy of the project and later push changes back.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arjit-32/highlight-hero
```

*Note - You can clone a repo that is present in your local too, in this case highlight-hero can be cloned again* 

```bash
git clone highlight-hero cloned-highlight-hero
```
