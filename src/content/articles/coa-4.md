The Control Unit (CU) is the CPU’s command center, directing all operations by decoding instructions and coordinating the ALU, registers, and memory.

## Role of the Control Unit

The CU manages the execution of each instruction by -

- Generating control signals to activate components.
- Directing data flow between registers, ALU, and memory.
- Synchronizing operations with the CPU’s clock.
- Updating the Program Counter to fetch the next instruction.

## Types of Control Units

### 1. Hardwired Control Unit

Built using fixed logic circuits (combinational logic + timing signals). It is fast and efficient, but inflexible as changing behavior requires redesigning hardware.

### 2. Microprogrammed Control Unit

Stores micro-instruction in control memory(ROM). It is slightly slower but easier to extend, used in complex CPUs like the Intel 8086.

## Conclusion

The Control Unit directs all CPU operations, transforming binary instruction to precise actions.
