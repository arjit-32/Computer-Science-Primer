Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer Hypertext *(outdated term for web related text)* and is the most common protocol for web and API communication. 
HTTP is: 

- **Stateless**: Each request is independent; the server doesn’t remember what you did before.
- **Request-response based**: The client sends a request, the server sends back a response.

## HTTP Request Flow (How It Works)

1. Your browser or app opens a **TCP connection** to the server.
2. It sends an **HTTP request**:
    
    ```bash
    GET /user/42 HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.example.com
    ```
    
3. The server responds:
    
    ```bash
    200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "id": 42,
      "name": "Alice"
    }
    ```
    
4. Connection is either closed or reused, depending on HTTP version.

## Common HTTP Methods

| Method | Use |
| --- | --- |
| **GET** | Fetch data (e.g., get user profile) |
| **POST** | Create a resource (e.g., add new user) |
| **PUT** | Replace a resource (e.g., update user info) |
| **PATCH** | Modify part of a resource |
| **DELETE** | Remove a resource |
| **OPTIONS** | Discover supported methods for a resource |
| **TRACE** | Diagnostic method for debugging |
| **CONNECT** | Establish a tunnel (e.g., HTTPS) |

## HTTP Headers

HTTP headers are **name-value pairs** that carry metadata with requests and responses.

*Examples:*

- `Content-Type: application/json` - tells the server what kind of data you’re sending
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` - used for authentication
- `Cookie: session_id=xyz` - Maintains session info
- `User-Agent: Chrome/120.0` - info about the client

## Stateless but Extendable

Although HTTP is **stateless**, meaning the server doesn't remember previous requests, we use tools like **Cookies, Sessions, Tokens (JWTs)** to maintain context across multiple interactions.

## HTTP Versions in Brief

| **Version** | **Key Characteristics** |
| --- | --- |
| **HTTP/0.9** | Single-line protocol with only GET method and HTML-only responses |
| **HTTP/1.0** | <ul><li>Added HEAD/POST methods, headers</li>  <li>Multiple content types</li></ul> |
| **HTTP/1.1** | <ul><li>Introduced persistent connections</li>  <li>Request pipelining *(sending multiple-inflight requests before the arrival of the responses of earlier request*)</li>  <li>Mandatory Host header *(helped in virtual hosting)*</li></ul> |
| **HTTP/2.0** | <ul><li>Prioritized resposes / multiplexing *(If 2 images requested, sends small image before bigger image*) </li> <li>Server push *(send resources to the client without it requesting)* </li><li> Binary protocol with header compression </li></ul> |
| **HTTP/3.0** | <ul><li>QUIC-based (UDP) transport with built-in TLS 1.3 </li> <li>Resolves Head-on-line blocking</li> </ul> |

`Note` - Most HTTP connection should use HTTPS over HTTP/2 and if that doesn't work should use HTTP 1.1
