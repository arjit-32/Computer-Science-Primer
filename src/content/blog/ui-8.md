This is where wireframes turn into a polished interface. Add colors, typography, and images, ensuring they match the brandâ€™s look and feel. Focus on consistency across elements like buttons, cards, and text. Use design systems or UI kits to keep things uniform. Ensure accessibility with good contrast and legible fonts. The goal is to make the design visually appealing and ready for developer handoff.
