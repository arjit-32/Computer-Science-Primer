## Userflows

Series of steps user takes to achieve meaningful goals

- **Define the User Journey**: Visualize the path users will take to achieve specific goals. For a Phone specification website, for example, consider the journey from the homepage to a detailed phone spec page, and perhaps even to a comparison or review page.
- **Estimate Screen Requirements**: Identify the key screens needed (e.g., homepage, phone category, detailed spec, comparison, review) and their interactions, so you can capture the full scope of the userâ€™s journey.

Some points to keep in mind - 

1. Name your Flow Screens ( Ex - Making a Payment ) 
2. Flow should only be in 1 direction to avoid confusion
3. Create distinct flows

## SiteMaps

Ensures that all pages are organized logically and that navigation is intuitive for users. A well-structured sitemap will help clarify the information architecture, ensuring users can easily find what they need.
