Programming languages are fascinating. But have you ever wondered **how they work under the hood?** As an academic exercise, I set out to build my own programming language **SudoLanguage**, a Hindi-inspired scripting language that transpiles to JavaScript!

## Features of SudoLang üåü

SudoLang provides fundamental programming constructs, all with Hindi-inspired syntax:

‚úÖ **Print Statements** ‚Äì Display output using `CHAPO` (like `console.log`).

‚úÖ **Variables & Assignment** ‚Äì Declare variables with `MANLO`.

‚úÖ **User Input** ‚Äì Accept input using `PUCHO`.

‚úÖ **Arithmetic Expressions** ‚Äì Perform calculations with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.

‚úÖ **Conditional Statements** ‚Äì Use `AGAR` (if) with `{}` blocks.

‚úÖ **Loops** ‚Äì Use `JABTAK` (while) for iterations.

‚úÖ **Comments** ‚Äì Add comments with `#`.

## Example Code in SudoLang

```javascript
MANLO x = 5;
CHAPO x;

PUCHO y;
CHAPO y;

AGAR (x > 3) {
    CHAPO "X bada hai!";
}

JABTAK (x < 10) {
    CHAPO x;
    MANLO x = x + 1;
}

# This is a comment
```

### Output 
```bash
5
10 ---> Entered by user
X bada hai
5
6
7
8
9
10

```


## Installation & Running

You can install SudoLang globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g sudolang
```

Then, run a `.hindi` script like this:

```bash
hindic myscript.hindi
```

## How it works ? (The Broader Picture)

1. **Lexer (Tokenizer)** ‚Äì Reads the source code **character by character** and converts it into **tokens**, the smallest building blocks of the language.
2. **Parser** ‚Äì Processes these tokens, checks if they follow the correct syntax, and structures them into a **parse tree** for execution.
3. **Emitter** ‚Äì Converts Intermediatory code into low level code, making it executable.

## Understanding the Grammar (BNF-like)

SudoLang follows a **BNF-like grammar** (Backus-Naur Form) to define its syntax. Here‚Äôs a simplified structure:

```bash
<program> ::= <statement_list>

<statement_list> ::= <statement> <newline> <statement_list>
                   | <statement> <newline>
                   | Œµ   (* Empty Line Allowed *)

<statement> ::= <assignment>
              | <print_statement>
              | <input_statement>
              | <if_statement>
              | <while_loop>

<assignment> ::= "MANLO" <identifier> "=" <expression> ";"

<print_statement> ::= "CHAPO" <expression> ";"

<input_statement> ::= "PUCHO" <identifier> ";"

<if_statement> ::= "AGAR" "(" <condition> ")" "{" <statement_list> "}"

<while_loop> ::= "JABTAK" "(" <condition> ")" "{" <statement_list> "}"

```

SudoLang follows a **recursive descent parsing** approach and supports **LL(1) parsing**, meaning it looks at only one token at a time without backtracking.

## Understanding Code Flow  üöÄ

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how the **different components** of SudoLang work together:

1. **package.json** - Defines the project, dependencies (`readline-sync`), and command-line executable (`hindic`).
2. **bin/hindic** -
    - Reads the `.hindi` source file.
    - Passes the code through **Lexer** (tokenizes), **Parser** (checks syntax & builds structure), and **Emitter** (transpiles to JavaScript).
    - Writes the JavaScript output to `temp.js`.
    - Runs the generated JavaScript using Node.js.
    - Deletes `temp.js` after execution.
3. **src/lexer** - 
    - **Scans the source code** character by character.
    - Groups them into **tokens**, which are later used by the Parser.
    - Creates `Token` objects, storing both the text (actual code) and type.
4. **src/emitter** -
    - Stores transpiled code in `this.code`.
    - Writes the final JavaScript output to a file.
5. **src/parser -** 
    - Reads tokens sequentially using `nextToken()`.
    - Matches tokens to **grammar rules** (like `if`, `while`, `let`).
    - Uses a **recursive descent approach** to parse expressions, conditions, and loops.
    - Generates JavaScript code by sending parsed structures to the **Emitter**.

## Deeper Dive: What‚Äôs Next?

Right now, SudoLang is a **transpiler** (converts one high-level language to another). But if we wanted to build a **true compiler** that generates machine code, we could explore:

 

1. **LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine)** - A compiler framework that generates optimized machine code for multiple architectures.

```css
Sudolanguage ‚Üí Lexer ‚Üí Parser ‚Üí LLVM IR ‚Üí Machine Code (x86, ARM, etc.)
```

2. **Direct Assembly Code Generation** - Emit **x86 assembly** and use an **assembler** (like `nasm`) to generate machine code.

3. **WebAssembly (WASM)** ‚Äì A low-level binary format that runs on modern browsers.

## Conclusion: Seeing the Matrix üëÄ

I‚Äôd **100% recommend** building your own compiler (even if it‚Äôs just a transpiler). It fundamentally changes how you see code.

Beyond learning about **lexing, parsing, and ASTs**, you gain something even more valuable:

1. **Programming is Abstraction**

A high-level language is just a bunch of strings that the compiler accepts. The compiler dictates the language - it breaks it down, checks validity, and converts it to low-level code. Then the cycle repeats until we reach machine instructions.

2. **Errors? They Excite Me Now.**

In sudoLang, I didn‚Äôt even bother giving useful message. Debugging feels less like a headache and more like a feature. Wow, atleast the language tells me where mistake might be !

3. **The Better You Understand Your Language, The Better You Write.**

Compilers don‚Äôt ‚Äúthink‚Äù‚Äìthey **follow rules**. The more you understand **how they optimize (or struggle)**, the better you can write better code.

Now, every time I write code, I ask myself:

ü§î What‚Äôs the **compiler doing**?

ü§î How is it **parsing this statement**?

ü§î How does this turn into **machine instructions**?
