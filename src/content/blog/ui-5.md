### **Purpose of Sketching**

Sketching is a quick, low-fidelity way to visualize ideas and map out user flows, helping you see the overall structure and identify essential screens.

### **Two-Step Sketching Process**

1. **Sketch to Generate Ideas**:
    - Start with rough sketches to get as many ideas out as possible.
    - Focus on exploring various layout options, navigation structures, and feature placements.
2. **Refine Sketches for Details**: 
    - Once you have a few promising ideas, refine the sketches by adding more detail.
    - Add essential elements like buttons, icons, labels, and basic layouts for key screens.

### **Key Elements to Include in Sketches**

- **Annotations**: Write brief notes around your sketches to explain specific features or interactions.
- **Screen Numbers**: Label screens to keep track of the flow and order.
- **Arrows**: Use arrows to indicate navigation paths or actions, like where a button will lead or how screens are connected.

Note - Keep sketches rough and fluid; the goal is to outline ideas, not perfect designs. This phase is about shaping functionality and flow before diving into Figma or high-fidelity designs.
